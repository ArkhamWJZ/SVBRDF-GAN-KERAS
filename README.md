## Requirements

- Python 3.6, numpy, Tensorflow-gpu 1.4
- 8G GPU Memory (test on GTX 1070)

## Usage

The following command will train the network on a captured image, and output intermediate result during training as well as recovered and synthesized SVBRDF maps of a cental cropped tile of the captured image (considering gpu memory).

```bash
python train.py --input_dir aittalaimgs/plastic_red_input.jpg --log_dir logs/0614-plastic_red --output_dir predictions/0614-plastic_red --crop_size 800
```

`--input_dir`  path to the captured image. We offer several images for testing, and the whole captured images dataset can be find  here: https://mediatech.aalto.fi/publications/graphics/TwoShotSVBRDF/ 

`--log_dir` folder to save checkpoint.

`--output_dir` folder to save recovered SVBRDF maps.

`--crop_size` define the size of a cropped tile from the captured image, default is 800. This tile is to be sent to the network and get 2Ã— size SVBRDF maps.  `crop_size` depends on the GPU memory, larger size might cause OOM error.

`--img_h, --img_w` define the height and width of your captured image, default 1224* 1632.
